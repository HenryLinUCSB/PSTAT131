## Elastic Net Tuning

For this assignment, we will be working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

Read in the file and familiarize yourself with the variables using `pokemon_codebook.txt`.
```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(ISLR)
library(ISLR2)
library(tidyverse)
library(glmnet)
tidymodels_prefer()
pdata = read.csv("~/PSTAT 131/homework-5/data/pokemon.csv")
```
### Exercise 1

Install and load the `janitor` package. Use its `clean_names()` function on the Pokémon data, and save the results to work with for the rest of the assignment. What happened to the data? Why do you think `clean_names()` is useful?
```{r}
library(janitor)
cleaned_pdata = clean_names(pdata)
cleaned_pdata
```
I believe what happened to the data is that the names for similar individual pokemon have been sorted together. I believe that clean_names() is useful in the sense that if we wanted a comparison with similar data sets in comparison to other similar data sets (all within the data), it'll be really useful. 


### Exercise 2

Using the entire data set, create a bar chart of the outcome variable, `type_1`.
```{r}
cleaned_pdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = type_1)) + geom_bar()

```

How many classes of the outcome are there? Are there any Pokémon types with very few Pokémon? If so, which ones?\
There are 18 different classes of the outcome. Flying and Fairy Pokemons has very few pokemons in comparison to other classes. 

For this assignment, we'll handle the rarer classes by simply filtering them out. Filter the entire data set to contain only Pokémon whose `type_1` is Bug, Fire, Grass, Normal, Water, or Psychic.
```{r}
cleaned_pdata <- cleaned_pdata %>%
  filter(type_1 == "Bug" | type_1 == "Fire"| type_1 == "Grass" | type_1 == "Normal" | type_1 == "Water" | type_1 == "Psychic")

```

After filtering, convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors.
```{r}
cleaned_pdata$type_1 <- as.factor(cleaned_pdata$type_1)
cleaned_pdata$legendary <- as.factor(cleaned_pdata$legendary)
cleaned_pdata$generation <- as.factor(cleaned_pdata$generation)

```

### Exercise 3

Perform an initial split of the data. Stratify by the outcome variable. You can choose a proportion to use. Verify that your training and test sets have the desired number of observations.
```{r}
set.seed(3435)
split_data <- initial_split(cleaned_pdata, prop = 0.9, strata = type_1)
train_data <- training(split_data)
test_data <- testing(split_data)

dim(train_data)
dim(test_data)
```
Next, use *v*-fold cross-validation on the training set. Use 5 folds. Stratify the folds by `type_1` as well. *Hint: Look for a `strata` argument.* Why might stratifying the folds be useful?
```{r}
data_fold <- vfold_cv(train_data, v = 5, strata = type_1)
data_fold

```
Stratifying the folds could be useful because by folding the data, each fold could be a representative of the entire dataset. 

### Exercise 4

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`.

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;

- Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}
# From lab 5
recipe_data <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp
                      + sp_def, data = train_data) %>%
  step_dummy(legendary) %>%
  step_dummy(generation) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())

```

### Exercise 5

We'll be fitting and tuning an elastic net, tuning `penalty` and `mixture` (use `multinom_reg` with the `glmnet` engine).

Set up this model and workflow. Create a regular grid for `penalty` and `mixture` with 10 levels each; `mixture` should range from 0 to 1. For this assignment, we'll let `penalty` range from -5 to 5 (it's log-scaled).

How many total models will you be fitting when you fit these models to your folded data?
```{r}
# 10 levels, mixture 0-1, penalty -5 - 5
penalty_grid <- grid_regular(penalty(range = c(-5, 5)), mixture(range = c(0,1)), levels = 10)
penalty_grid
# set up model: fitting and tuning an elastic net, tuning `penalty` and `mixture` (use `multinom_reg` with the `glmnet` engine).
tuning <- multinom_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = tune()) %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("glmnet")
# Set up workflow
data_workflow <- workflow()%>%
  add_recipe(recipe_data)%>%
  add_model(tuning)
```
500 total models will be fitted when we fit these models into the folded data.
### Exercise 6

Fit the models to your folded data using `tune_grid()`.

Use `autoplot()` on the results. What do you notice? Do larger or smaller values of `penalty` and `mixture` produce better accuracy and ROC AUC?
```{r}
fitted_model <- tune_grid(data_workflow, resamples = data_fold, grid = penalty_grid)
# Use autoplot()
autoplot(fitted_model)


```
From the result, I noticed that `penalty` and `mixture` produce better accuracy and ROC AUC with smaller values. 

### Exercise 7

Use `select_best()` to choose the model that has the optimal `roc_auc`. Then use `finalize_workflow()`, `fit()`, and `augment()` to fit the model to the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

```{r}
#Use `select_best()` to choose the model that has the optimal `roc_auc`.
best_model <- select_best(fitted_model, metric = "roc_auc")

#Then use `finalize_workflow()`, `fit()`, and `augment()` to fit the model to the training set
finalize_workflow_model <- finalize_workflow(data_workflow, best_model)
pokemon_fitted <- fit(finalize_workflow_model, data = train_data)

#evaluate its performance on the testing set. Discussed and worked with Abhay Zope
evaluate_model <- augment(pokemon_fitted, new_data = test_data) %>%
  accuracy(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class)
evaluate_model

```

### Exercise 8

Calculate the overall ROC AUC on the testing set.
```{r}
augment(pokemon_fitted, new_data = test_data, metric = 'roc_auc')

```
Then create plots of the different ROC curves, one per level of the outcome. Also make a heat map of the confusion matrix.
```{r}
# Worked and discussed with Abhay Zope
augment(pokemon_fitted, new_data = test_data, metric = 'roc_auc') %>%
  roc_curve(type_1, estimate = c(.pred_Bug, .pred_Fire, .pred_Grass, .pred_Normal, .pred_Water, .pred_Psychic))

#Heatmap
augment(pokemon_fitted, new_data = test_data) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = type_1, estimate = .pred_class) %>%
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
  
  

```

What do you notice? How did your model do? Which Pokemon types is the model best at predicting, and which is it worst at? Do you have any ideas why this might be?

From testing the data sets and fitting them, the performance on testing sets resulted relatively weak. In exercise 7, the test result showed on roughly 48% testing accuracy on the data, which would would make this model fairly inaccurate. The heatmap from exercise 8 indicates that the model is not good at predicting 'Fire' and 'Grass' types of Pokemon. The Pokemon types that the model is best at predicting would be 'Normal', 'Psychic', and 'Water'. Even though 'Bug' type of pokemon has little prediction results, we could still put this type of pokemon as types that the model is best at predicting. As discussed with my peers, I've learned that a Pokemon's type has no correlation with its stats/attributes, therefore, this could be the reasoning behind why the model is best/worst at predicting specific types of pokemon.
